I am a Korean passionate researcher with a strong background in *Operating System*, *Computer Architecture* and *Computer Networking*. My current work focuses on ***userspace system call interception***, ***inter-VM shared memory and device sharing***, ***intra-node network acceleration*** and ***device simulation*** such as ***Processing-In-Memory device***. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at [Computer Systems and Platforms Laboratory](https://csap.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University. Before that, I was at High Performance Computing Lab, Inha University.
